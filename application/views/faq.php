                    During the busy seasons, team members will work about 45-50 billable hours/week, Monday-Saturday.  As each deadline approaches, additional hours may be needed to help firms meet internal and external deadlines.  To help offset the increased hours during these times, Agaram offers its employees reduced hours and a four-day workweek during the off-seasons.        </div>
